# 12. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

## 12.1 Each of the clauses of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.

## 12.2 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

## 12.3 You may not assign, subcontract or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may freely assign, subcontract or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of our rights or obligations under these Terms in which case:

### 12.3.1 we will provide you with reasonable notice of such transfer; and

### 12.3.2 if you do not wish to be transferred, you must cancel your agreement to these Terms by cancelling your Account and/or ceasing to use Safe People Registry prior to transfer.

## 12.4 Nothing in these Terms shall create or be deemed to create a partnership between you and us.

## 12.5 Save as expressly set out in these Terms, a person who is not a party to these Terms has no right to enforce any part of these Terms.
